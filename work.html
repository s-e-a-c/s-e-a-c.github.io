    <p style = "width: 66%;" >
        GoPaint is a digital painting application for mobile VR headsets. I started this project because I wanted to do more
        digital painting, and I liked the idea of being able to work on paintings on a large virtual canvas with a headset that I could
        easily bring with me anywhere. A little while later and I had the tool I was dreaming of, and am very pleased and honored to see
        people using it all around the world.

        <a name = "animo" class = "anchor"></a>
        <p style = "width: 66%;" >
            Animo is a stop motion animation tool for virtual reality. Using simple shapes as building blocks you can model characters 
            and environments which can then be animated and enriched with live recordings or saved audio. The goal of this project is to 
            create a tool that is easy to learn and capable of creating painted models, animated loops, and whole stories from start to finish.

        <p style = "width: 66%;" >
            Curve Tool gives the user the ability to concept 3D models in virtual reality using an editable hierarchy of 
            bezier curves.

            Neptune is a node-based procedural PBR texture editor and painter. Currently in the concept stage, this tool aims 
            to provide artists with the ability to design and apply materials to 3D models in an immersive context.

            <p style = "width: 66%;" >
                I've made an erosion simulator in Unity based on the paper 
                <a href = "http://hpcg.purdue.edu/bbenes/papers/Stava08SCA.pdf" >"Interactive Terrain Modeling Using Hydraulic Erosion" - Stava et al. 2008. </a>
                This an ongoing personal project that will develop into a node-based terrain generator and editor.

        Swerve is Pong in VR. I did this project a couple of years ago with the goal of putting
        something up on the GearVR store. I wanted to put a virtual spin on a classic game, and had
        a lot of fun in the process.

        <p style = "width: 66%;" >
            I've been making gifs for some time now. I always aim to make them pleasing to look at for a while, even though
            most are only two second repetitions. I love the challenge of creating entrancing infinite loops with very few frames.

            I love to make 3D models, both as an artistic pursuit as well as a challenge to craft
            clean topology and highly optimized virtual assets.
