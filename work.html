        GoPaint is a digital painting application for mobile VR headsets. I started this project because I wanted to do more
        digital painting, and I liked the idea of being able to work on paintings on a large virtual canvas with a headset that I could
        easily bring with me anywhere. A little while later and I had the tool I was dreaming of, and am very pleased and honored to see
        people using it all around the world.

            I've made an erosion simulator in Unity based on the paper 
            <a href = "http://hpcg.purdue.edu/bbenes/papers/Stava08SCA.pdf" >"Interactive Terrain Modeling Using Hydraulic Erosion" - Stava et al. 2008. </a>
            This an ongoing personal project that will develop into a node-based terrain generator and editor.

            I've been making gifs for some time now. I always aim to make them pleasing to look at for a while, even though
            most are only two second repetitions. I love the challenge of creating entrancing infinite loops with very few frames.

            I love to make 3D models, both as an artistic pursuit as well as a challenge to craft
            clean topology and highly optimized virtual assets.
